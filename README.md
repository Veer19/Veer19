I'm a developer who loves building AI-powered tools from idea to execution. Whether it's crafting slick UIs, setting up scalable backends, or hacking together voice + LLM integrations — I do it all.

An expert in talking to ChatGPT and figure out anything, currently experimenting at the intersection of **AI, automation, and user-centric design**.
